- Perform feature engineering if needed.

- Explain all preprocessing decisions clearly.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generate statistical summaries and visualizations.

5. Model Development
- Implement at least two machine learning models: baseline model and
improved/optimized model.

- Use appropriate ML algorithms depending on the project type.
6. Model Evaluation
- Use correct evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, ROC-AUC, etc.).

- Compare baseline and improved model performance.

- Provide clear visualizations for evaluation.

7. Discussion & Conclusion
- Explain what the results mean.

- Reflect on limitations of your model.

- Propose future improvements.
